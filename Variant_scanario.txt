Scenario: Genetic Variant Classification in Clinical Bioinformatics

Objective: Classify genetic variants as Pathogenic (P), Likely Pathogenic (LP), Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS), Likely Benign (LB), or Benign (B).

Dataset: Use real-world sources such as ClinVar, gnomAD, HGMD, COSMIC to train the model.

Features (Predictors):

- Variant Type (Missense, Nonsense, Splice-site, Indel)

- Conservation Scores (PhyloP, PhastCons)

 - Allele Frequency (gnomAD, ExAC)

 - Protein Impact (PolyPhen, SIFT)

 - Splice Effects (SpliceAI)

 - Regulatory Region Effects (ENCODE, RegulomeDB)
